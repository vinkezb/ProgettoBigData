However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.\n\nIt might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of @angular/language-service.\n\nIf you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you donâ€™t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>FAQ and help</summary>\n\n  There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html).
